This Emacs package provides a mechanism for REPLs (or comint buffers,
in Emacs parlance) to display graphics and other types of special
content.

The main motivation behind this package is to display plots in the
Python shell. However, it does more than that.

First, it is not constrained to graphics, and can display other "MIME
attachments" such as HTML and LaTeX content. In fact, the Python
backend of the package implements IPython's [[https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/integrating.html#rich-display][rich display interface]]. A
use-case beyond the displaying of graphics is to render
dataframes as HTML tables; this opens up the possibility of
typographical improvements over the usual pure-text
representation. You can also easily define rich representations for
your own classes.

Second, the package defines a flexible communication protocol between
Emacs and the inferior process, and, consequently, can be extended to
other comint types. Currently, besides Python, there is support for
the regular (Unix) shell. In this case, a special command, =mimecat=,
is provided to display content. Again, this works for images, HTML,
LaTeX snippets, etc.

** Usage

To start enjoying comint-mime, simply call =M-x comint-mime-setup=
from a supported buffer (which, at the moment, are the =M-x shell= and
=M-x run-python= buffers). To apply this permanently, add that same
function to the appropriate mode hook:

#+begin_src elisp
  (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'comint-mime-setup)
  (add-hook 'inferior-python-mode-hook 'comint-mime-setup)
#+end_src

For Python it is recommended to use the IPython interpreter.  It can
be configured to have the same look-and-feel as the classic =python=
program as follows.

#+begin_src elisp
  (when (executable-find "ipython3")
    (setq python-shell-interpreter "ipython3"
          python-shell-interpreter-args "--simple-prompt --classic"))
#+end_src

If using the regular =python= interpreter, only Matplotlib figures are
supported, and you need to call =plt.show()= and =plt.close()=
manually to display and create new figures.

** Extending

To add support for new MIME types, see =comint-mime-renderer-alist=.

To add support for new comints, an entry should be added to
=comint-mime-setup-function-alist=. This function should arrange for
the inferior process to emit an escape sequence whenever some MIME
content is to be displayed.

The escape sequence has the following shape:

#+begin_example
  ESC ] 5 1 5 1 ; header LF payload ESC \
#+end_example

Here, =header= is a JSON object containing, at least, the entry
=type=, which should be the name of a MIME type. Other header entries
can be passed; the interpretation is up to the rendering function.

The =payload= can be either the content of the attachment, encoded in
base64 (which is decoded before being passed to the selected
renderer), or a =file://= URL (whose content is read and passed to the
renderer), or yet a =tmpfile://= URL, which indicates that the file
should be deleted after it is read.

Note that it can take considerable time to insert large amounts of
data in a comint buffer, specially if it contains long lines. Consider
using a temporary file for large data transfers.
